Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
In my final project I made a few functions at the beginning that processed some csv files into dictionaries and lists.
I used those functions so much and it was so easy. I didn't have to rewrite any code or remember exactly how the functions
worked. I was able to just call them and give the arguments.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions allow you to quickly scan over an entire file without having to poke around in every corner looking for problems.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
My process is to read the error if their is one, then reread the code looking for typos or improper syntax. After that if I haven't
found the problem I use the debug mode to walk through the program step by step. 
I could improve this process by testing more frequently to avoid having to comb through large amounts of code.
